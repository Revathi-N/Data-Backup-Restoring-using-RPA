 ABSTRACT:
Data backup is the process of backing up the data, refers to copying the data into an archive file of computer data so it may be used to restore the original after a data loss event. Backups have two distinct purposes. The primary purpose is to recover data after its loss, it can be data deletion or corruption. Data loss can be a common experience of computer users while transferring the data. 
The secondary purpose of backups is to recover data from an earlier time, according to a user-defined data retention policy, typically configured within a backup application for how long copies of data are required.These processes can be fully automated with the RPA solutions by providing them with the required credentials, source and destination details for the whole task to be automated. 

MODULE SPLITUP:
Module 1: Mail automation    (N.Revathi)
Module 2: Backup process     (R.Sreerag)
Module 3: Restoring process  (K.Piraivendhan)
Module 4: Orchestrator connection

PROPOSED SYSTEM:
In our proposed system, the data from the different sources are collected on a daily basis through mail. The bot will be trained to the process of extraction of data based on condition. The process will be idle until the admin triggers the bot using orchestrator. After the triggering factor, the files from the different sources are collected as a master file. The backup process is done for the master file.
After the backup process, the restoring process is executed.

ADVANTAGES OF PROPOSED SYSTEM:
*It can help scale resources and meet the need of growing business data.
*Boost efficiency and effectiveness of the system.

PROJECT COMPLETED TILL NOW:
Project has been completed and we are focussing on the accuracy of the system.
